        <h2>Tahiti Resort</h2>
        <p>This project was a website built for a luxury resort in the French Pacific. On the page, you can book rooms for adults and children, make dinner reservations, apply for their gym membership, and much more. The project uses HTMl and CSS for the visual presentation. In the project's next phase, logic will be added to it using JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Adopt a Puppy</h2>
        <p>The aim of this project was to raise awareness of street animals. An estimated 750 million dogs are born without owners, most of which end up on the street. As on can imagine, that's a lot of dogs for animal services to keep up with! Adopt a Puppy was built to help solve this problem. If people adopted more puppies of the streets, the risks that come with free-ranging canines would be reduced significantly.</p>
        <p>This simple website was built with HTML and CSS.</p>
